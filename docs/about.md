# About this Project
This is a rapid prototype development effort underway by members of the Common Astronomy Software Applications 
(CASA) team at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

This software is subject to change without notice. It has not been thoroughly tested or verified and should be
considered demonstration only.

An official release is planned for the future, at which time more rigorous testing and 
change control/communication will be in place.
