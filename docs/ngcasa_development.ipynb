        "The initial exercise of defining the ngCASA API and constructing usage examples for Imaging, Calibration, Flagging and Simulation raised the following questions related to code structure, functional hierarchy, data formats, and usage of CNGI. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Visibilities zarr/xarray : A default list of array names is as defined in CNGI. But, to get the ability to have versions of arrays, any application may add arrays as needed. Examples are corrected_data_1, corrected_data_2, flag_original, flag_auto, etc. All additional arrays must conform to the same meta-data and coordinates. But now, all methods (even CNGI) need the ability to specify an array name to use, with the default being from the core definition. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Image zarr/xarray : What is the default list of array names (i.e. image products) to store here ? The current specification in CNGI is tied closely to the casa6 tclean's list of outputs. However, not app applications/users will need this full list. Therefore, we perhaps should require that an image dataset contain a minimum of 1 array with a predefined default name, but then allow the appending of more. All image arrays within a set must share the same shape and coordinate metadata. Here too, all methods (even CNGI) that operate on images must have the ability to specify an array name to use. \n",
        "\n",
        "- A Caltable : Need to define the default structure of a zarr/xarray dataset meant to store calibration solutions. Same requirements from above apply here too.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Primary Beam models Convolution Function Cache : We need a persistent data structure to store and use gridding convolution functions. The imaging prototype is developing one, related to the casa6 CFCache. A mechanism to convert between a Primary-Beam model database and a convolution function cache must also be designed. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Flux Component List : We need a definition of a component list as an alternative to a raster image. This is required for compatibility with catalogues and translation between sky models that are not fitted/evaluated on a pixellated grid. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Visualization requirements\n",
        "To support flexible interactive visualization as part of algorithms and applications, the following must be evaluated/considered when the visualization module is designed/prototyped.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Array 'versioning' implemented as separately named arrays allows a user to visualize multiple versions (of flags, or corrected_data, or model_Data). The visualization tool should allow the specification of what arrays to use/plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - On-the-fly visualization must be possible by inserting a call to a plotter in between any sequence of steps in a user application script, using the currently-available xarray dataset (which may or may not have a zarr counterpart).  An example use case is autoflagging where it is often useful to inspect flags, discard them, try new autoflag parameters, re-inspect, and save flags only when satisfied. \n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Visualization must apply to zarr/xarray datasets such that they are usable (interchangeably, within reason) for visibility datasets, caltables and images. This merges the roles of what has traditionally been separate in casa6 as plotms and the viewer and will get us (at least) scatter and raster displays for all kinds of datasets that we support. \n",

        "- Join operation for zarr/xds datasets for visibilities, images, caltables, CF-caches, etc. A common use case is to combine data from multiple datasets that may not share meta-data or be consistent in shape. Some algorithms must be done on each dataset (or subset) separately, whereas others are to be done on an entire set. A related situation applies to image datasets.  We need a demonstration of how to achieve this. Also, what bookkeeping complexity can the framework actually eliminate ? Should the rules be the same for visibilities and images or not ? A prototype should result in a recommendation, a demonstration that it simplifies some book-keeping, and that it does not overly bloat the dataset (with NaNs).\n",

        "    - Option2 : Implement a join and then use data selection as needed. All applications then strictly can take single datasets as inputs. Algorithms such as imaging can view it as a single large dataset. However, for some algorithms (such as calibration solutions that must pay attention to different meta-data across subsets) the internal diversity will still have to be managed through loops inside the methods.\n",

This is perhaps just an ngCASA or CNGI method that implements the math, along with a 'regrid' for coordinate re-mapping. \n",
