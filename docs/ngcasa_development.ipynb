        "\n",
        "(1)  Are img_datasets expected to contain one image at a time, or entire sets used for imaging ? \n",
        "    - Some methods need to see sets of associated images, whereas others need just one image.\n",
        "    - Some methods change the shape of the image, but it is still associated with the same reconstruction run\n",
        "    ==> It seems best to restrict an img_dataset to contain only one image array. \n",
        "    \n",
        "    Example : Cube vs MFS have different image definitions. \n",
        "    For mtmfs, major cycles are cubes, and minor cycles are MTMFS. \n",
        "    So here, should both definitions reside inside the same img_dataset \n",
        "    and the deconvolver know to look for some naming convention ?  \n",
        "    How to do this cleaner ? \n",
        "    \n",
        "(2) How to reconcile the 'stateless function' approach with the need for maintaining iteration control state right through an image reconstruction run ? => The application layer will have to manage return-vals, inp_vals and 'state' ?\n",
        "\n",
        "(3) When to use parameters to a single method, versus having multiple methods ?  The former allows for cleaner application code. The latter allows for more atomic code structure.  => Decide on a case-by-case basis ? \n",
        "\n",
        "(4) Are there rules for what data-array names are allowed in the XDS and Zarr datasets ? Can we implement 'versioning' of arrays simply by picking different names ? E.g. Versions of corrected_data or flags. This is something in the MS V3 that we have needed for a long time.    All the above usage examples assume this is possible. \n",

        "  E.g. vis.chanaverage() followed by 'edit CORRECTED_DATA' (e.g. uvcontfit+uvsub), and then write back to original dataset. This makes no sense. So, how to prevent this ?\n",

        "\n",
        "- Visualization ? \n",
        "  - Point to available python libs for data visualization...\n",

        "  - It can be inserted between any sequence of steps in any user application script.\n",
        "  - Will apply to vis and cal datasets, and img datasets too. This will get us scatter and raster displays for all kinds of datasets...\n",
