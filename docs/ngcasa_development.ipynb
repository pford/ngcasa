        "#### Visibilities zarr/xarray\n",
        "A default list of array names is as defined in CNGI. But, to get the ability to have versions of arrays, any application may add arrays as needed. Examples are corrected_data_1, corrected_data_2, flag_original, flag_auto, etc. All additional arrays must conform to the same meta-data and coordinates. But now, all methods (even CNGI) need the ability to specify an array name to use, with the default being from the core definition. \n",

        "#### Image zarr/xarray\n",
        " What is the default list of array names (i.e. image products) to store here ? The current specification in CNGI is tied closely to the casa6 tclean's list of outputs. However, not app applications/users will need this full list. Therefore, we perhaps should require that an image dataset contain a minimum of 1 array with a predefined default name, but then allow the appending of more. All image arrays within a set must share the same shape and coordinate metadata. Here too, all methods (even CNGI) that operate on images must have the ability to specify an array name to use. \n",

        "    - Option1 : Always work with small homogeneous subsets of data and have the application layer manage lists and merging of products (via loops). \n",
        "    - Option2 : Implement a join and then use data selection as needed. All applications then strictly can take single datasets as inputs. Algorithms such as imaging can view it as a single large dataset. However, for some algorithms (such as calibration solutions that must pay attention to different meta-data across subsets) the internal diversity will still have to be managed through loops inside the methods.\n",
        " \n",
        "  Current CASA6 has a mix of both the following and this is a significant source of inconsistency. Can the new framework simplify any book-keeping for this use-case without sacrificing other aspects such as performance ? \n",

        "  - Should there be a join operation for images, should there only be custom combination methods, or should the application layer manage lists of image sets ?\n",
        "  - Example use cases are linear mosaics where a list of small images is combined onto a larger image grid (as an explicit weighted average of images, where the primary beam is used as the weight) and multi-field imaging where main and outlier fields have vastly differing meta-data.\n",

Equivalence with casa6's standard gridder has been established along with a performance comparison and demonstrations on a local workstation (with pre-specified resource constraints) as well as AWS. \n",

        "  - Array 'versioning' implemented as separately named arrays allows a user to visualize multiple versions (of flags, or corrected_data, or model_Data). The visualization tool should allow the user to specify what (non-default) array names to use/plot.\n",

        "  - On-the-fly visualization must be possible using the currently-available xarray dataset (which may or may not have a zarr counterpart).  \n",
        "   - Flagging : An example use case is [autoflagging](https://ngcasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ngcasa_flagging.html#Autoflag-with-extension-and-pre-existing-flags) where it is often useful to inspect flags, discard them, try new autoflag parameters, re-inspect, and save flags only when satisfied. \n",

        "\n",
        "  - Visualization must apply to zarr/xarray datasets such that they are usable (interchangeably, within reason) for visibility datasets, caltables and images. This merges the roles of what has traditionally been separate in casa6 as plotms and the viewer and will get us (at least) scatter and raster displays for all kinds of datasets that we support. \n",
