        This function is not yet implemented
    
    A flag manager that applies Boolean logic operators to
    
    - merge multiple flag versions into one.
    
    - delete flag versions
    
    - list existing version names
    
    Inputs :
    
    (1) List of input flag array names
    (2) array name for output flags. Default = FLAG
    (3) Operation (AND, OR)  TBD : supply the expression, instead of canned options.
    
    If an existing flag array is named as the output, the contents are over-written.
    
    Returns
